Title: Human_Drone_Markers

Youtube Link: https://youtu.be/ADEjLrapVeE


Context:
‘Human_Drone_Markers’ seeks to take a metaphorical approach to simulate the experience of monitoring and searching. 
The project aims to explore the emotional experiences of migratory movements and the implications of mass surveillance.
(This project acts as the inception for further research into surveillance, invasion of privacy and responsibility.)


Research Questions:
 - How does the simulation of surveillance contribute to the audience's understanding of the concealed aspects of migration issues, and does it evoke a sense of responsibility or action?
 - How does the implementation of sound to depict distance impact participants' emotional responses and understanding of the challenges faced by migrants during their journeys?


Objectives:
- Prompt political reflection on the implications of mass surveillance
- Targets audiences who takes interest in the critical issue of humanitarian concerns (specifically migratory movements)
- Encourages participants to engage with data through performing tasks such as surveillance and monitoring
- Develop a new interface to understand migration experiences
